# Amor-Cms
A headless and mostly serverless CMS in Javascript

 
Amor is a headless, mostly serverless CMS built entirely in JavaScript. This CMS allows you to manage and deliver content with just a simple JavaScript library, without the need of a complex server-side infrastructure. Perfect for developers who want to integrate dynamic content into their frontend applications, whether it's for static sites or more complex setups.

## Key Features

Headless Architecture: Separate content management from the frontend. Deliver content to any frontend, using any thirdparty framework.

Serverless & Simple: No need for Node.js or backend servers for basic use. The minimal viable approach of Amor-Cms is possible on any simple webspace. However you can scale with more advanced server setups as your needs grow.

## Setup Choices

Amor's goal is to be lightweight, fast, and easy to integrate. There is no one-size-fits-all setup, but depending on your needs, youâ€™ll likely end up with one of the following approaches, or something in between:

1. Minimalistic: no Backend required: Simply include the JavaScript library in your site, manage content by uploading/downloading your content in form of JSON-Files from/to your webspace or web-server.
2. Intermediate: use your own webserver to manage enhanced security and other options. Extend the provided Amor-classes and/or write your own APIs. Integrate data from thirdparty APIs by extending Amor's abstract Transformer-class 
3. Advanced: integrate Amor-Cms into your own infrastructure and architectures based on your specific requirements by using or extending the classes of the provided Amor-library
